useState
-----------------
Used to handle react of data
Any data that changes in the application is called state
When changes in the data occur you want react to update the UI
useState takes only 1 argument:	
	the default state
	useState(0)

The useState function returns an array with 2 values
	const [count, setCount] = useState(0)


rules for using useState hook
-----------------------------------------
Can only be used inside function components
Cannot be used inside of ifs, loops, functions


USING useState hook
-------------------------------
1. Import the hook
	import React, { useState } from 'react';

2. call it
	useState

3. set default
	useState(0)

4. set array of values the useState will return
	const [count, setCount] = useState(0)
	count = current state, can be called anyhting
	setCount = updating the current state, also can be called anything

5.  Use the useState hook by setting curent state:
	<button>-</button>
	<span>{count}</span>
	<button>+</button>

6. make the current state update:
	maybe add a click event handler
	<button onClick={minusCount}>-</button>
	<span>{count}</span>
	<button onClick={addCount}>+</button>

7. create the fucntions to handle events
	function minusCount() {
		setCount(prevcount => prevcount - 1)
	}
	function addCount() {
		setCount(prevcount => prevcount + 1)
	}
