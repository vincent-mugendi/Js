ES6 NOTES


VARIABLES AND SCOPING
---------------------------------------------
Variables in ES6 are declared using:
	1. var can acessed outside scope where it declared
	2. let allows variables to be used only in the scope where they are declared

	let example
	-----------
	var x = 10;
	// Here x is 10
	{
  		let x = 2;
  		// Here x is 2
	}
	// Here x is 10


const keyword
-----------------------
Used to declare a variable whose value cannot be reasigned
constants are also like let, can only be used within a block scope
use const keyword to declare them
	example
	-------
		const pi = 3.14;


this keyword
--------------------


Arrow function
--------------
Allows short syntax for writing function expressions
they are not suited for defining object methods.

In arrow functions you DONT need:
	1. funcion keyword
	2. return keyword
	3. {} curly braces

	example
	--------
	const x = (x,y) => x * y; //declared a function in a variable x that takes two parameters, x and y, 
								and returns their product (x * y)
